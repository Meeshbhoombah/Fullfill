## About the Projecti
Fulfill is a system where friends and family assign you tasks to perform by texting your phone number. Upon completion of the task the user is awarded points based on the difficulty of the task. If you do not complete the task in the allotted time, you lose points. This basic system of gaining and losing points is then displayed on a leaderboard, which adds a social aspect to doing completing mundane tasks. This system also has an augmented reality display, and allows you to navigate the app via gesture control.
